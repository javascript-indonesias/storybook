# Storybook Lit Demo

This example directory represents the application you wish to integrate storybook into.

Run `yarn install` to sync Storybook module with the source code and run `yarn storybook` to start the Storybook.

When developing things in `@storybook/lit` you can run `yarn build lit --watch` in the root folder of the monorepo and both changes in the example code or in `@storybook/lit` will be reflected in the UI.
